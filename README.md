## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- TikTok
- Pokemon TCG
- Discord

- Features of Tiktok
- Being able to repost and share videos with such a unique UI is only something TikTok has.
- 2x a short video on Tiktok
- Tiktok Shop is one feature that only tiktok has perfected as it combines a market with a social media platform

- Pokemon TCG
- The feature of being able to play against other people with the cards you get in the game
- Having UI that lets you showcase your favorite cards that you pulled
- Being able to trade and communicate with other players

- Discord
- By far my favorite feature is the cross platform integration, whatever device you are on, you can communicate to anybody with discord
- Being able to share your screen
- The ability to add AI and code chatbots to your personal servers 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While building this app, I had difficulties getting used to the UI and how the formatting of swift is.
